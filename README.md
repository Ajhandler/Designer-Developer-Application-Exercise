# Designer Developer Application Exercise

Welcome prospective designer developer!

This is the implementation portion of the Designer Developer
Application exercise that you received directly. This part corresponds
to the https://github.com/hedgeyedev/Developer-Applicant-Exercise for
developer applicants. Position specific projects like this one are an
early step of the technical interview process at
[Hedgeye](http://www2.hedgeye.com).  The purposes for this exercise are
twofold:

1. To expose the applicant to a microcosm of how they would submit code at Hedgeye: git, github, pull requests.
2. A test of the applicants to follow directions and execute on front
   end skills.  Often a resume and/or cover letter don't fairly
   represent what the applicant is capable of, this exercise hopefully
   helps display what an applicant is capable of

# Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Go into the *design* directory and follow the instructions in the README.md.
3. In the *markup* directory, implement a responsive landing page, that matches the mobile mockups you created in part 1, with HTML, CSS and any frameworks of your choosing (SASS, less, PostCSS, bootstrap, foundation, etc.).
4. In the *pick_me* directory
   * Add a file pick_me.txt which describes why we should choose you as a designer developer.  It would be nice to stand out, but a fallback would be typical cover letter type verbiage.
   * Fill out the `questionnaire.txt` and commit it.
   * Anything else we should know.  For example, portfolio, oper source projects, one of your preferred development tools (editor, desktop app, etc.) and why you use it, etc.

# When you're done

1. Commit and Push your code to your fork.
2. Send a pull request, we will review your design code and get back to you.  If your GitHub profile does not include your name, please include your name in the pull request.


Good luck!
